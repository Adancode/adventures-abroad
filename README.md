Project requirements met:

1. Two API's: nytimes API and flickr API

2. New library or technology: mapael.js

3. Must have a polished frontend/UI: used BootStrap to enable a cohesive theme, and selected map colors which made sense based on the data.  App is responsive.

4. Must not use alerts: Used a modal that pops up when the user leaves any comment input field empty.

5. Must have a repeating element: the user comments populate a table via Firebase.

6. Must use Bootstrap or alternative CSS Framework: used Bootstrap

7. Must be deployed: heroku, http://dry-hamlet-81240.herokuapp.com/#

8. Must have user input validation: the name and comments input box that generates when a country is clicked will not accept any input if either of the two input fields is blank.

9.  Utilize Firebase for persistent data storage: the comments users input are stored in Firebase and retrieved via the comments section.

10. Use an alternative CSS framework like materialize: requirement #6 said to use Bootstrap or an alternative framework and so we went with Bootstrap, but materialize is really cool, we did take a look at it.
